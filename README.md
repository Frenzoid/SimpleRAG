# SimpleRAG

SimpleRAG is an implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Python. RAG enhances the capabilities of generative language models by integrating retrieval-based methods to provide more contextually relevant responses.

## Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval-based techniques with generative language models to improve response quality by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge source before generating responses. This implementation leverages Python for processing and managing the integration between retrieval mechanisms and language generation models, and doesn't require or use of any authentication token with Meta, Huggignface, or else.

## Features

- **Document Processing**: Extracts and processes text from PDF documents to build a knowledge base using Unstructured, in the example were using as dataset a Linux manual book and the entire AWS Serverless Documentation.
- **Database Management**: Stores and manages a vectorial database for the processed documents for efficient retrieval using ChromaDB.
- **Language Model Handling**: Integrates with language models to generate responses augmented with retrieved information, in the example we are using Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Frenzoid/SimpleRAG.git
   cd SimpleRAG
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Set up the environment**:

   Ensure that all necessary configurations are set in `configs.py`.

## Usage

**Run the Main Application**:

   Just start the main application:

```bash
   python main.py
```

   This will initialize the system, allowing it to handle queries using the RAG approach.
   After this initial run, you may want to set `CHROMA_LOAD` on `configs.py` to `False`, so next runs will load the dataset instead of recreating the entire thing.

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. It allows you to manage users, groups, roles, and their permissions. IAM enables fine-grained access by defining policies to specify which actions are allowed or denied for specific resources. With features like multi-factor authentication (MFA) and temporary credentials, IAM enhances security. It supports identity federation, allowing external users to access AWS without creating IAM users. IAM is essential for managing secure access and ensuring compliance in AWS environments.
